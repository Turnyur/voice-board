# Voice Based Electronic Notice Board

The System accepts voice input from a user and uses voice recognition technique in decoding the words of the user.
It then transmits the information obtained though bluetooth to a remote hardware sub-system that displays the information obtained from the Android application in a liquid crystal display mounted on the embedded device.

The Voice Recognition mechanism uses Google voice recognition API


I developed the Android app with Android Studio and the source files can be found [here](https://github.com/Turnyur/voice-board/tree/master/VoiceBoard)  

The app screenshots is shown below
